I am currently a student at TripleTen Bootcamp for their Business Intelligence Analyst program. 
I have a bachelor's degree from Ball State University majoring in Business Administration and Information Systems.
I have currently knowledge in SQL, spreadsheets, and Tableau. 
I have been a homeschool teacher for the past 6 years but I am excited to get back into the businesss world.
